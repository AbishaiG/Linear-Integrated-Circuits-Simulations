Instance "m:u1:5": Length shorter than recommended for a level 2 MOSFET.
Instance "m:u1:6": Length shorter than recommended for a level 2 MOSFET.
No AC stimulus found:
     Set the value of a current or voltage source to "AC 1."
     to make it behave as a signal generator for AC analysis.
Direct Newton iteration failed to find .op point.  (Use ".option noopiter" to skip.)
